A simple website meant to compile all the currently released One Pace episodes.<br/><br/>
If you don't know what One Pace is, it is a fan-made project intended to cut out the filler heavily present in the One Piece anime.<br/><br/>
Their website is currently down, so I made this simple alternative which links to every episode they have available in the highest quality option they have.<br/>
This is only for the Japanese Language with English Subs versions however. If you want to watch the English dub or other languages, please check out the official One Pace discord.<br/><br/>
The Website Link is Here: https://botwiscool123.github.io/One-Pace-Site/
